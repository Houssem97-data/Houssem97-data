Iâ€™m @Houssem97-data. Iâ€™m currently learning more about Natural Language Processing (NLP), using Python and R. Right now, I'm focusing on Python and exploring libraries like
**spaCy**, **NLTK**, and **Transformers** to build and analyze text-based models. I'm always eager to learn from others, so any advice, resources, or project ideas are very welcome!
Looking forward to connecting with others in the data science and NLP community. ðŸ˜Š
